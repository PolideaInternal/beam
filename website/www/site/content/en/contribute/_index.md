   ## Overview

</a>

<div class="collapse dont-collapse-sm" id="collapseOverview">

There are lots of opportunities to contribute. You can for example:

- ask or answer questions on [user@beam.apache.org](/community/contact-us/) or
  [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-beam)
- review proposed design ideas on [dev@beam.apache.org](/community/contact-us/)
- file [bug reports](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues)
- review [changes](https://github.com/apache/beam/pulls)
- work on the core programming model (what is a Beam pipeline and how does it
  run?)
- improve the developer experience (for example, Windows guides)
- organize local meetups of users or contributors to Apache Beam

...and many more. Most importantly, if you have an idea of how to contribute, then do it!

Below is a tutorial for contributing code to Beam, covering our tools and typical process in
detail.

### Prerequisites

- a GitHub account
- a Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows development environment with Java JDK 8 installed
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed for some tasks including building worker containers and testing this website
  changes locally
- [Go](https://golang.org) 1.12 or later installed for Go SDK development
- Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. Yes, you need all four versions installed.

  pip, setuptools, virtualenv, and tox installed for Python development

- for large contributions, a signed [Individual Contributor License
  Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) (ICLA) to the Apache
  Software Foundation (ASF).

</br>

{{< highlight1  >}}
sudo apt-get install \
   openjdk-8-jdk \
   python-setuptools \
   python-pip \
   virtualenv \
   tox \
   docker-ce

{{< /highlight1  >}}


You also need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

</br>

Once Go is installed, install goavro:

</br>

{{< highlight1  >}}
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`/sdks/go/examples/.gogradle/project_gopath
$ go get github.com/linkedin/goavro
{{< /highlight1  >}}


Linux users should configure their machines for sudoless Docker.

### Connect With the Beam community

- Consider subscribing to the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us/), especially
  if you plan to make more than one change or the change will be large. All decisions happen on the
  public dev list.
- (Optionally) Join the [#beam channel of the ASF slack](/community/contact-us/).
- Create an account on [Beam issue tracker (JIRA)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues)
  (anyone can do this).

### Share your intent

- Find or create an issue in the [Beam issue tracker (JIRA)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues).
  Tracking your work in an issue will avoid duplicated or conflicting work, and provide
  a place for notes. Later, your pull request will be linked to the issue as well.
- If you want to get involved but don't have a project in mind, check our list of open starter tasks,
  [https://s.apache.org/beam-starter-tasks](https://s.apache.org/beam-starter-tasks).
- Assign the issue to yourself. To get the permission to do so, email
  the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us)
  to introduce yourself and to be added as a contributor in the Beam issue tracker including your
  ASF Jira Username. For example [this welcome email](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e6018c2aaf7dc7895091434295e5b0fafe192b975e3e3761fcf0cda7@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E).
- If your change is large or it is your first change, it is a good idea to
  [discuss it on the dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us/).
- For large changes create a design doc
  ([template](https://s.apache.org/beam-design-doc-template),
  [examples](https://s.apache.org/beam-design-docs)) and email it to the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us).
